Quelea Mobile Remote is an Android and iOS app that allows you to remotely control the free church projection software Quelea. It is a customized version of the web site remote control feature for easier access.

This is a port of the [Android version](https://github.com/quelea-projection/quelea-android-remote) that is not yet complete. However, the most basic features are implemented and the app is in a working state. See the [TODO file](TODO.md) for the current progress state. This version is currenty not available in any app store but can be built for own usage.

All kinds of donations are appreciated and will allow me to set aside more time for development. You can use [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ArvidNy) for a monthly donation or send a one-time donation through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/ArvidNy).

The entire code is open source, so free to help improve the code or to use it for your own projects.

### Known issues:
 None

### Troubleshooting
1. Make sure wifi is enable on your device and that you are connected to the same network as the computer with Quelea.
2. Check the URL in your web browser to make sure that the URL works as it is supposed to. If it does, then it's actually a issue with the app, otherwise it's a network-related issue.
3. Try changing port in Quelea. In case you have any other software using the same port, this will resolve the conflict.
4. Disable firewall and anti-virus temporarily to make sure that's not where the problem lies. If it is, you will have to add an exception in it for Quelea.
5. You might have to check your router settings to make sure port forwarding is enabled. This is different for every brand so please consult your product manual for this.

### Permissions:
* *Full network access* - Only used to connect to the Quelea server. The app can be used with no Internet connection as long as it has access to the same network as the server.
* *Prevent phone from sleeping* - Means that the screen is kept active as long as the app is running. It is possible to manually turn off the screen at any time.
* *View Wi-Fi connections* - Used in auto-connect feature to find server IP.
